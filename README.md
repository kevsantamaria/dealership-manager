# dealership-manager

Dealership Manager is a web-based application designed to manage an automobile dealership's inventory, allowing administrators to handle vehicles for sale, their specifications, and availability. The system follows a frontend–backend architecture, built with React and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, Express on the backend, and a PostgreSQL database, and it also uses direct SQL queries (no ORM) for database access.
